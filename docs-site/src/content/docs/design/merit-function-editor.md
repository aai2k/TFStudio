The **Merit Function Editor** is where you tell the optimizer what "good" looks
like. Every target the design should hit and every constraint on the layer
stack lives here, expressed as a list of **operands**. Each operand is a single
number the optimizer tries to drive toward a target value, and the merit
function (MF) is the weighted root-mean-square of how far each operand misses:

```
MF = √( Σ_i  w_i · residual_i²  /  Σ_i w_i )
```

The weight `w_i` enters linearly. The residual is `value − target` for an
equality target, or a one-sided `max(0, …)` term for an inequality or
constraint (so a satisfied constraint drops out of the sum entirely).
Wavelength-valued residuals are rescaled to optical scale first so they don't
dominate. A smaller MF is better; the optimizers — Refinement, Needle and
Gradual Evolution — move layer thicknesses to reduce it.

## Operand types

The table below is a quick orientation. The full catalog — every type, its
arguments, its output value and unit, and how it forms a residual — is on the
[Operand Reference](/design/operands/) page.

| Group                | Types                          | Output                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Single-λ optical     | `T` `R` `A`                    | T/R/A at one λ               |
| Band average         | `TAV` `RAV` `AAV`              | mean T/R/A over a band       |
| Spectral target      | `TGT` `RGT` `AGT`              | deviation from a flat/ramp line |
| Weighted integral    | `TIW` `RIW` `AIW`              | source × detector weighted mean |
| Worst-case           | `TMN` `RMN` `AMN` `TMX` `RMX` `AMX` | band extremum of T/R/A   |
| Argmax/min λ         | `MXWT` `MXWR` `MXWA` `MNWT` `MNWR` `MNWA` | wavelength of the extremum |
| Math (reference rows)| `OPGT` `OPLT` `OPVA` `ABSO` `ABGT` `ABLT` `DIFF` `SUMM` `PROD` | derived from other rows |
| Thickness            | `TT` `MNT` `MXT`               | total / per-layer thickness  |
| Comment              | `BLNK` `DMFS`                  | inert                        |

Reflection and transmission targets are typically generated in **paired** rows
by the filter-type wizard so the optimizer can't trade absorption for an easy
win.

## Settings

**Filter-type wizard** — at the top, a set of coating categories (AR, HR,
bandpass, notch, edge filters, ramps). Pick the goal and the wizard fills in
sensible weights and operands you can then refine.

**Operand table** — one row per operand; edit any cell inline. The advanced
columns set each operand's weight, angle of incidence, polarization and an
optional surface-mode override.

**Constraints** — set minimum and maximum layer-thickness bounds (`MNT`/`MXT`)
per layer or per material. A bound can be written to cover layers that
synthesis will add later.

## MF vs OMF

The header shows **two** numbers:

- **MF** — the full merit function, including the manufacturing and thickness
  constraints (`MNT`, `MXT`, `TT`).
- **OMF** — the **optical merit function**: the same RMS but counting *only the
  optical operands* (T/R/A targets, bands, and so on), with the thickness
  constraints dropped.

They separate two questions the plain MF blurs together: *how good is the
spectrum?* (OMF) versus *how good is the spectrum while honoring my thickness
limits?* (MF). When MF is high but OMF is low, the optical performance is fine
and it is a constraint — a too-thin or too-thick layer — costing you, not the
optics.

## How to read it

Each operand row shows its current value and its residual, so you can see at a
glance which targets are met and which are dragging the merit up. Bigger
weights make an operand count for more; bumping the stopband weight on an HR
design is the most common tweak.

The operand list is saved with the design and is read by every optimizer:
[Refinement](/synthesis/refinement/), [Needle](/synthesis/needle/),
[Gradual Evolution](/synthesis/gradual-evolution/) and the
[Structural Optimizer](/synthesis/structural-optimizer/). The synthesis tools
optimize against the optical operands only while they build the stack, then the
thickness constraints are enforced during Refinement — a good final sequence is
Refinement, then Cleaner, then Refinement again.
